This is WIP for an extension that allows you to green all the websites you visit and reduce your environmental footprint.

The vision is to integrate environmental impact metrics (CO2, Water, etc); Green Mode degradations that give the user the power to remove bloat and unnecessary features, from ad trackers to JavaScript; and carbon offsets for impacts: all this in a carbon aware way.

v.0 will begin by integrating several key extensions from https://github.com/Adora-Foundation/awesome-green-extensions into a single extension. 


So far I have integrated GreenIT-Analysis and EnableJavascript extensions by way of POC. This already allows you to get a solid start on environmental impact metrics from any site you visit, and watch them improved when you toggle JavaScript off for that tab (the toggle only applies per tab, so other tabs will have JavaScript enabled).

Version 0.01 is a very rough experiment, and needs much cleaning up, but already demonstrates the value in the concept. 

Next I hope to add a few more core extensions around power consumption management (Tab Suspender), carbon offsetting, and some more graceful degradations, carbon awareness, and a start on Smart Mode.

With that core functionality in place, v1 will involve re-architecting the collage for cleaner and more elegantly modular code, and likewise a fully integrated UI.

V2 will eventually mean adding new, purpose built functionality.

Contributions are welcome, whether you wish to add new functionality, streamline and improve the code, or contribute to documentation.
